For this type of tasks, it might be more practical to download python and an IDE (An environment in which you program on your own machine). As such, have a look [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17tS0maWyzORUsIjmCVEszfqrl2X4By-Cy2Sw3ENG5lA/edit?usp=sharing) before you start.\n",

    "* The user must be able to write a number in a cell of their choice. If the number is invalid, i.e. not between 1 and 9, an error message will be printed.\n",
    "* The user must not be able to fill in a number that already exists in the same row, column, or square.\n",
    "* The user must be able to delete a number from a cell.\n",
    "* Every time the user fills in or deletes a number, the new board will be printed in a nice manner. An example is given below (numbers above and next to the board that indicate column- and rownumber, respectively).\n",
    "* The user must be able to load a board from a text file.\n",
    "* It must be possible to save an incomplete board to a file, so that it can be finished later.\n",
    "* The must print a nice congratulations in case the user succesfully completes the board.\n",
    "* Everything shall be done through a user friendly interface. I.e. the user will not have to call the functions themselves, but everything is done through input or reading from/writing to file.\n",
