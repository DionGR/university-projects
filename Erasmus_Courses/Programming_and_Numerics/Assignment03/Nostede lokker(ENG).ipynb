    "Nested loops refers to having loops within other loops. An example of a nested loop is a double loop, which means that there is a loop within another loop. Double loops are used a lot in programming, typically when you are solving problems which are in some way two dimensional, for instance associated with matrices or two dimensional tables of numbers. Two dimensional here can mean purely visual (for instance drawing something to the screen and updating the color of each point in a grid of pixels), but does not have to have any visual meaning. Two dimensional can refer to dimensions of information in a more abstract way. For instance, the two dimensions could represent numbers and values in a deck of cards, then we can generate an entire deck of cards using a double loop as follows:"

In order to make it a little less predictable, you can even use the function `random()` in order to generate a random number for each iteration of the loop, and use an if statement to choose verbs based on the value of this. For instance, \"loves\" if the number was > 0.9, and less strong verbs for lesser values."
