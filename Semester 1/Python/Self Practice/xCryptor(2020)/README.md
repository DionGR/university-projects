# xCryptor

xCryptor is a unique message encryption/decryption tool, as well as my first Python project.

## Requirements

1) string
2) random
2) pyperclip


## Usage/Abilities

1) Generate encryption tokens on-the-spot.
2) Reuse old generated tokens. You can use one token to keep encrypting/decrypting messages between your friends!
3) Encrypt/Decrypt full on paragraphs written in English, including special characters (i.e. @, !, #) and spaces.
4) Read the token from a file so you do not have to keep copy-pasting it.
5) Read a message from a file so you do not have to manually write it down.
6) Export the decrypted message on a file.
5) Each decryption token is unique. It can be rearranged in 95! (1.032998e+148) different ways.
