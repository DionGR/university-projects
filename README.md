# University Projects

## Description
A repository that contains projects I developed during my studies as a Computer Science undergraduate at the [Athens University of Economics and Business[(https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/infotech-overview-en)]. It also includes projects from my Erasmus+ exchange in the graduate Computer Science program at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) at Trondheim.

Some projects are notable, some are in Greek, and some might not even be functioning, as this repository is mostly used as an archive.

## Notable Projects

There's a few notable projects that exhibit depth in a certain area of Computer Science. I chose to focus my studies on Software Engineering as well as Machine Learning. 

### Machine Learning

### 3D Segmetation of Coronary Arteries - The ASOCA Challenge [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/3d-segmentation-coronary-arteries-asoca)]

A graduate Computer Vision & Deep Learning project that focuses on sophisticated techniques for a complex problem. More on the ASOCA challenge in the linked repository.

### Comparative Analysis of Generative and Neural Topic Modeling Techniques Applied to Modern Greek Political Corpora [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/greek-pm-topic-modeling)]

A graduate Natural Language Processing project that focuses on an end-to-end analysis using topic modeling for Greek political texts.
