# University Projects

## Description
A repository that contains projects I developed during my studies as a Computer Science undergraduate at the [Athens University of Economics and Business](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/infotech-overview-en). It also includes projects from my Erasmus+ exchange in the graduate Computer Science program at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) at Trondheim.

Some projects are notable, some are in Greek, and some might not even be functioning, as this repository is mostly used as an archive.

## Notable Projects

There's a few notable projects that exhibit depth in a certain area of Computer Science. I chose to focus my studies on Software Engineering as well as Machine Learning. 

### Machine Learning

### 3D Segmetation of Coronary Arteries - The ASOCA Challenge [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/3d-segmentation-coronary-arteries-asoca)]

A graduate Computer Vision & Deep Learning project that focuses on sophisticated techniques for a complex problem. More on the ASOCA challenge in the linked repository.

### Comparative Analysis of Generative and Neural Topic Modeling Techniques Applied to Modern Greek Political Corpora [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/greek-pm-topic-modeling)]

A graduate Natural Language Processing project that focuses on an end-to-end analysis using topic modeling for Greek political texts. 

## Software Engineering

### Duel of Fates - Turn Based Multiplayer Card Game [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/duel-of-fates)]

An Android-based multiplayer card game that was developed using best practices in Software Engineering. The most notable aspect of this project is the extensive design documents that describe the architecture of the game as well as the reasoning behind the design decisions.

### Tempo Activity Tracker [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/distributed-activity-tracker)]

An Android-based activity tracker that was developed as part of a distributed systems course. The project focuses on the implementation of map-reduce from scratch in Java using a master-worker architecture and a client that interacts with the server. 

### Chess SGG [[link](https://github.com/DionGR/Chess_SGG)]

A C++ project that implements a chess game using Simple Graphics Game library. The project focuses on the implementation of a chess game with a GUI with a focus on game logic.
